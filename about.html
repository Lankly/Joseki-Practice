            <h2>How to Use This Site</h2>
            <p>This site is for practicing go/baduk/weiqi josekis. Don't know what go is? <a href="https://online-go.com/learn-to-play-go">Get started here!</a></p>
            <p>
                The board initially starts empty.
                From this point, you can play the first move of any of the supported Josekis and the computer will play out a random follow-up from <a href="http://www.josekipedia.com">Josekipedia</a>.
                The computer will only play follow-ups that are tagged with the selected filters on the right-hand side ("Ideal", "Good", "Bad", "Trick", and "Question" moves).
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to play as White, you can select that on the right-hand side under "Player".
            </p>
            <p>
                If you wish to practice a specific Joseki, you can select any of the specified josekis under "Starting Point" on the left-hand side, then click the "Go!" button.
            </p>
            <p>This site is best used by knowing which Joseki you'd like to practice in advance, selecting it, and playing against the computer, trying to remember what the best moves are.</p>

            <h3>Why Don't You Add This Joseki/Feature?</h3>
            <p>I'm open to changing the site to suit people's needs. Feel free to message me about it!</p>

            <h3>I Found a Bug</h3>
            <p>Message me on Twitter and I'll fix it as soon as I can.</p>
            <p>If the bug you've found is related to mobile devices, it is unlikely that I will fix it. This site is meant for desktop.</p>

            <h3>Your Website is Broken</h3>
            <p>Before reaching out to me, please check that Josekipedia and <a href="https://allorigins.win">AllOrigins</a> are not down.</p>
            <p>If Josekipedia is down, then the website will not function, as it pulls all its data from there.</p>
            <p>If AllOrigins is down, then it cannot fetch data from Josekipedia.</p>
